ECS Architecture - Entity Component System

Entity - Container tags

Component - Data containers which we can attach to the entity.
For example:

Different types of components:-
1) Single Property - <a-box position ="0 0 0">
2) Multi-property - <a-entity light ="type: directional; intensity: 1; color="yellow">
